## Introduction

My accountant told me that I need pay a large amount of HST for next year. I started to understand why this quick method is.


## Calculation

Assuming the total income excluding HST is $I$ here, the total HST will be $0.13 \times I$. Say you have $T$ taxable expenses.

- Regular return method

$$R_{r} = 0.13 \times I - \frac{T \times 13}{113} $$

- Quick method omitting the 300 plus little amount (Simplied for calculation)

$$R_{q} = 1.13 \times I \times 0.088 $$

Now we want $ R_q < R_r $. By solving this inequality, we have $$ \frac{I}{T} > 3.76 $$

Basically, it means that when $T$ is lower than $ 0.265 \cdot I $, it will be better to use quick method for HST. If the taxable expenses is much higher, then it's better to use regular HST return.
