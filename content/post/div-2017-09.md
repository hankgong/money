Since September is the quarterly dividends distribution month, the dividends income received this month is my best since I started my investment one and half years ago.

According to the figure, we can see the average monthly dividends have reached a small milestone of $300/month. I was planning to increase the monthly dividends to $400/month at the end of this year, which requires another $30,000 under the assumption of 4% dividends rate. However, I'm also selling my house and moving to another neighboring city, which will drain my cash flow until end of year. I have already throwed in around $3K to clean and renovate my current house.
